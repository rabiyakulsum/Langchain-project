# LangChain Project Overview

This project explores various components and functionalities within LangChain, specifically focusing on Chains and Evaluation methods. LangChain provides robust tools for constructing workflows with language models, as well as for evaluating model outputs.

## Part 1: Chains in LangChain

Chains are essential elements in LangChain, allowing the connection of multiple actions to build modular workflows.

### Outline

1. **LLMChain**
   - A simple chain that connects inputs to outputs through a single language model call.

2. **Sequential Chains**
   - Chains that execute a sequence of actions in a specific order.
   - **SimpleSequentialChain**: Runs a straightforward sequence of actions.
   - **SequentialChain**: Allows more complex sequences with dependencies between steps.

3. **Router Chain**
   - A flexible chain that routes inputs to the most suitable model or chain based on the input type or content.

## Part 2: LangChain: Evaluation

Evaluation in LangChain provides tools for generating examples, manual and automated assessments, and debugging workflows.

### Outline

1. **Example Generation**
   - Automatically create example inputs and outputs to support evaluation and testing.

2. **Manual Evaluation (and Debugging)**
   - Perform hands-on evaluation and troubleshoot chain outputs as needed.

3. **LLM-Assisted Evaluation**
   - Leverage language models to assist in the evaluation process for efficiency and accuracy.

4. **LangChain Evaluation Platform**
   - A platform within LangChain for structured and systematic evaluation of chain outputs.
